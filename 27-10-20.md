# I got lots of pressure
The last time being relaxed is a very long time ago. My brain is always thinking. I just can't stop it. Maybe I should google what should I do when I'm overthinking? It can't help. I know the reason well. I need more than before, but the time I have everyday is limited, it's only 24 hours.

There is no balance any more. I don't know what to do. Living in the world is not pleasure as before.
