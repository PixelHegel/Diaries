# The first one

I don't know what should I write if somebody let me right something about my life. I don't know where to start. I even don't know what language I should use.

I fall in love with reading. It's not bad. At least I get something to do, to comfort myself with the strange language. Do you know what does it like? A child, without the ability to express himself. It's very painful. I can't stand it anymore. I aways say that it's the time to make changes. Yes, things are changing. But they are very slowly. What I should do for now, it's slow down, keep the things on the track and then wait. The thing will come is coming. What I need is more patient.

Good night
